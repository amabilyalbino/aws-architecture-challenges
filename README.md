# 3-Tier Application Deployment Challenge

## Challenge Overview

This challenge focuses on **deploying and managing** a 3-tier web application using various AWS services and DevOps practices. The application itself is provided - your challenge is to master different deployment strategies, infrastructure management, and operational excellence practices.

### What You'll Deploy

A complete user registration system with:
- **Web Tier**: Multi-step form interface with responsive design
- **API Tier**: RESTful backend with form submission handling
- **Database Tier**: MySQL database with user data persistence

### The DevOps Challenge

The application code is ready - your focus is on:
- **Infrastructure Design** - Choosing the appropriate AWS services for each tier
- **Deployment Automation** - Implementing repeatable deployment processes
- **Operational Excellence** - Monitoring, logging, security, and scalability
- **Cost Optimization** - Balancing performance with cost efficiency

## DevOps Implementation Areas

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **CloudFormation** - AWS native infrastructure templates
- **Terraform** - Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
- **CDK** - Code-based infrastructure definition
- **Parameter management** - Systems Manager Parameter Store/Secrets Manager

### **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
- **CodePipeline** - AWS native CI/CD orchestration
- **CodeBuild** - Managed build service
- **CodeDeploy** - Automated deployment service
- **GitHub Actions** - Third-party CI/CD integration

### **Monitoring and Observability**
- **CloudWatch** - Metrics, logs, and alarms
- **X-Ray** - Distributed tracing
- **AWS Config** - Configuration compliance
- **CloudTrail** - API activity logging

### **Security and Compliance**
- **IAM** - Identity and access management
- **Security Groups** - Network-level security
- **WAF** - Web application firewall
- **Certificate Manager** - SSL/TLS certificate management

### **Cost Management**
- **Cost Explorer** - Cost analysis and optimization
- **Budgets** - Cost monitoring and alerts
- **Trusted Advisor** - Cost optimization recommendations
- **Reserved Instances** - Cost reduction strategies

## Challenge Progression

### **Level 1: Foundation (EC2 Self-Hosted)**
- Deploy application on single EC2 instance
- Configure security groups and networking
- Set up RDS database with proper security
- Implement basic monitoring with CloudWatch

### **Level 2: Scalability (Load Balanced)**
- Implement Application Load Balancer
- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
- Configure Auto Scaling Groups
- Set up RDS Multi-AZ for high availability

### **Level 3: Automation (Infrastructure as Code)**
- Convert manual deployment to CloudFormation/Terraform
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Configure automated backups and recovery

### **Level 4: Advanced (Container/Serverless)**
- Choose containerized (ECS) or serverless (Lambda) approach
- Implement advanced monitoring and logging
- Configure blue/green or canary deployments
- Optimize for cost and performance

### **Level 5: Enterprise (Multi-Region/Compliance)**
- Deploy across multiple regions
- Implement disaster recovery procedures
- Configure compliance monitoring
- Set up advanced security controls

## Learning Outcomes**

- AWS service selection and configuration
- DevOps pipeline implementation
- Infrastructure automation capabilities
- Operational troubleshooting skills

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of web applications
- Familiarity with command line tools
- Git for version control

### **Choose Your Path**
1. **Start Simple** - Begin with EC2 self-hosted deployment
2. **Jump to Modern** - Start with containerized or serverless if experienced
3. **Focus Area** - Choose based on career goals (infrastructure, containers, serverless)

### **Documentation Structure**
- **`docs/ec2-selfhosted-deployment/`** - Traditional server deployment


Each deployment path includes:
- Architecture diagrams
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- Best practices and troubleshooting guides
